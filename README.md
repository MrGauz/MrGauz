### 👋 Hi, I'm Kirill

- 🇩🇪 I write code for a living in Munich, Germany
- 🧑‍💻 It's mostly python, less often PHP and C#
- ☕ Apart from programming my nights away, I like [cooking](https://github.com/MrGauz/recipes) and coffee

**Things I do:**
- [Todoist](https://github.com/MrGauz/home-assistant-todoist) and [Munich Public Transport (MVG)](https://github.com/MrGauz/home-assistant-munich-transport) plugins from [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
- [A Telegram bot](https://github.com/MrGauz/eugenebot2021) to congratutate a friend on his birthday with a digital quest through the city. My friend [Dani](https://github.com/danielbilyk) has beatifully described this story [here](https://vas3k.club/post/13774/).
- Write a bunch more Telegram bots because they can solve about any problem.
